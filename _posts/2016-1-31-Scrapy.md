title: Scrapy for Difficult Data
---

Billboard Music's chart histories have key features that one might use in a dataset, such as highest rank achieved, rank last
week and weeks on the chart, shown [here](http://www.billboard.com/artist/280012/soundtrack/chart). However, when inspecting the element of the page, the numeric data seems to be taken over by the adjacent icon. Where one would expect the rank and icon to be a sibling elements, instead the rank is nested in the li class above the icon. 

<ul class="chart_stats">
      <li><i class="icon peak"></i>1<span class="tt">Peak position</span></li>
      <li><i class="icon shift"></i>17<span class="tt">Last week's position</span></li>
      <li><i class="icon duration"></i>25<span class="tt">Weeks on chart</span></li>
    </ul>


This makes it looks like the peak position of the sound track (which is 1) should be in the `<i class="icon peak">` section, but instead it is above it. Therefore we have to extract the `<li>` class above it and find the index for the appropriate position. We do this by two nested  for loops, the first so that Scrapy can scrape each album in the Billboard 
chart list, the second to extract each the highest rank achieved, rank last week, and weeks on the chart:


           for i in response.xpath('//article[contains(@class,"song")]'):  
            chart_stats = i.xpath('.//ul[@class="chart_stats"]//text()').extract(),  
            chart_list = []  
            for j in chart_stats[0]:  
                if j.strip() != '':  
                    chart_list.append(j)  
            peak = chart_list[0]  
            last = chart_list[2]  
            weeks = chart_list[-2]
