### More Information

Bauer (Caroline) McClave's introduction to Data Science was through a masters program in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at Columbia University. After graduate school she joined Nielsen Claritas in their Data Science Department, focusing on market segmentation with clustering algorithms and cart trees with the PRISM Syndicated Product. She then moved to the Spectrum Platform Company, inspired by their NLP Algorithms and event based data, where she started as a Senior Data Scientist and moved to the Director of Business Analytics. After taking the time to switch from Python to R at Metis, she joined the Gannett | USA Today conglomerate on their Data Science teams in predictive modeling, NLP for automated keyword optimization, and creating pipelines to deploy models.

This summer, she worked in social impact, high-level strategy, and human-centered design in a fellowship at Blue Ridge Labs, a Robin Hood Foundation partner. Developing StreetShield, a resource for homeless New Yorkers to give feedback on their housing journey, has improved my skills in managing projects, building relationships, recruiting respondents, and showing how data can transform decision-making processes. She is now working as a freelance data scientist for mission driven companies and organizations, as well as businesses owned by women and people of color.
